## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build your own Voice Assistant using Python and the ChatGPT API. With this Voice Assistant, you can perform various tasks, get answers to questions, control your computer, and more, all through voice commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- An API key for the ChatGPT API. You can get one by signing up on the [OpenAI platform](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/asthalochan/Own-Voice-Assistant.git
   cd voice-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `voice_assistant.py` with your actual ChatGPT API key.

## Usage

Run the Voice Assistant:

```
python astha_ai.py
```

You can now interact with the Voice Assistant by speaking commands into your microphone.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: The Voice Assistant uses speech recognition to understand your voice commands.

- **ChatGPT Integration**: It sends your voice commands to the ChatGPT API, which provides responses and executes actions based on your requests.

- **Customizable**: You can extend the functionality of the Voice Assistant by adding more commands and actions to the code.

- **User-Friendly**: The Assistant provides spoken responses and can be easily customized to have different voices or personalities.

## Examples

Here are some example commands you can try:

- "What's the weather like today?"
- "Tell me a joke."
- "Open Google Chrome."
- "Set a timer for 5 minutes."

Feel free to modify the `astha_ai.py` script to add your own commands and responses.
